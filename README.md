# Java Concurrency Project: Backend Simulation for a Streaming Platform

## Project Brief

Develop a robust backend system for a simulated streaming service, inspired by real-world systems used at companies like Netflix or Canva. This backend should efficiently manage high levels of user concurrency, ensuring thread safety, data integrity, and performance under load. The system will expose endpoints for various user actions, such as streaming, account management, and content browsing.

## Objectives

1.	Implement Concurrency: Leverage Java’s concurrency utilities to handle simultaneous user requests effectively.
2.	Create RESTful Services: Develop endpoints that simulate user interactions with the streaming service.
3.	Ensure Data Integrity: Employ synchronization and other concurrency control mechanisms to maintain data accuracy across concurrent operations.
4.	Containerization: Package the application into Docker containers to mimic a real-world microservices deployment.

## Technical Requirements

1.	Thread Management: Utilize Java’s ExecutorService to manage a pool of threads that handle incoming HTTP requests.
2.	Synchronization Mechanisms: Use locks, semaphores, or synchronized blocks to prevent race conditions and ensure thread safety.
3.	REST API Implementation: Build RESTful endpoints using Spring Boot that handle requests such as GET /video/stream/{id}, POST /user/login, and PUT /user/profile.
4.	Data Handling: Simulate database interactions with in-memory data structures (like ConcurrentHashMap for storing user sessions), ensuring ACID properties where necessary.
5.	Logging and Monitoring: Implement logging for debugging and monitoring using frameworks like Log4J or SLF4J.
6.	Unit and Integration Testing: Write comprehensive tests using JUnit and Mockito to ensure functionality and concurrency safety.
7.	Docker Deployment: Provide Dockerfiles and Docker Compose scripts for deploying the service locally and potentially on cloud platforms.
